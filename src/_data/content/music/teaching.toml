I have over a decade of experience teaching the piano, the organ, music theory 
and musicianship skills, and I would love to share that experience with you. 

My teaching philosophy centers the student and their needs. No two students are 
the same (even twins!), and every student has different aspirations, learning 
styles, motivations, interests, and personalities. I tailor my teaching style 
and what we cover to every student, considering their needs and goals. 

Central to my approach is the principle of teaching the student, not the 
subject. Therefore, the teacher-student relationship always comes first — 
before deadlines, goals, or schedules.

I am presently located in the Raleigh-Durham area in North Carolina, and am on 
the faculty of Raleigh School of Music. I offer in-person private instruction 
to students located in the Triangle area, but I also offer onlilne lessons, 
and currently have a small studio of regular online students. If you are 
interested in lessons, please don’t hesitate to reach out! Consultation is 
free; I am always happy to chat. 

I am currently offering support in these four main areas, but always tailor 
instruction to the individual needs; I’m happy to cover a variety of mixed 
topics.

I take online security and privacy pretty seriously, and I believe in being
transparent, ethical, and consensual. I minimize third-party code, and I use
self-hosted solutions whenever possible.

## Cookies

This website uses _no cookies at all_. Not a single one. Not a crumb! The only
data that is stored on the client side (i.e. your browser) is the products your
cart â€” if you use the shop. That's it!

## Your information

Of course, if you make a purchase, I get notified about that, and I can see what
you've bought. But you can be confident that your information is not being 
distributed to anyone in any way at all. I might reach out to you to see how 
satisfied you are with a purchase, but that is the sum total of how your 
information might be used.

I do log IP addresses for form submissions on the [contact page](/contact/).
These are added to a database on my private, self-managed server, and that
information is _only_ used for spam prevention.

## Tracking & analytics

I use a self-hosted instance of [ShyNet](https://github.com/milesmcc/shynet) for
web analytics. I chose ShyNet because it does not require Javascript, and it
uses no cookies. It is therefore anonymous, and no data that is collected can be
linked back to you directly.

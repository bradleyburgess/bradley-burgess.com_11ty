I am passionate about building websites that are fast, responsive, accessible, 
and ethical. (If you haven't yet, check out my short blurb on [ethical web design](/dev#ethical-web).

I begin with getting a sense of who you are and what you're looking for in a 
website. It's really important to nail down what features you need, as this
sppeds things up later. It also helps me decide what kind of technology will 
best suit your site. Are you mostly doing just a static site? A blog? 
E-commerce? During this phase, I'll also ask you to send me links of things you 
like in other sites — this could be designs, color pallettes, features, etc.

Once we've established the overall design, sitemap and features, I move to 
prototyping with [Figma](https://www.figma.com). Ths great thing about this 
tool is that you can see what I'm doing live, which fascilitates collaboration 
in this step.

After that, it's time for coding! That is the fun part. (Well, for me.)

<h2 class="fs-700 mt">A note on Wordpress</h2>

Wordpress isn't my first choice for new websites, as I think there are way 
better options that are more resilient, easier to maintain, and less prone to 
security vulnerabilities. But, if you are adamant on having a Wordpress site, 
I will absolutely work with you on it.

A website audit can give you a handle on the strengths of your site as well as

A security is particularly important if your website is built with Wordpress. 
As powerful as it is, the Wordpress platform is notorious for security 
vulnerabilities, such as SQL injection.

An accessibility audit will give you an overview of how easily your site can be 
navigated by the user — especially those with visual, auditory, or mobility 
impairments.

Performance / core web vitals auditing looks at how well the site performs. I
check how well the site performs on slow connections, devices of varying sizes, 
with Javascript disabled, and I check it with Google's standards for best 
practices.

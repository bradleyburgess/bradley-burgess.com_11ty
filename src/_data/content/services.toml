I’ve been privileged to be able to study with some truly excellent teachers, and
I have a passion for sharing the knowledge that I’ve been given with others. I 
have over a decade of teaching experience, and would love to talk to you about 
starting lessons.

The teacher-student relationship is the foundation for all learning, and I do 
everything I can to build trust and create a safe environment for students. In 
lessons with me, there are no silly questions or obvious answers — we all have 
different strengths and backgrounds. I also do everything I can to be 
accommodating and understanding; while I do have a studio policy, I do 
understand that life happens, and sometimes things come up. Some weeks we can’t 
practice as much as we want to, and sometimes we have to cancel lessons. That’s 
ok.

My long-term goal in teaching is to make students independent. That’s why I take
every opportunity to incorporate learning healthy technique and good practice
strategies into lessons. 

I always offer a free 30-minute consultation for new prospective students. This
is an opportunity to get to know each other a little, for us both to see if it
would be a good fit, and for me to formulate an idea of what your (or your
child’s) interests and goals are.

Having only taken up the organ more seriously in my mid-twenties, after having

themselves having to play at church — I'd love to talk to you!

I am passionate about building websites that are fast, responsive, accessible, 
and ethical. (If you haven't yet, check out my short blurb on [ethical web design](/dev#ethical-web).

I begin with getting a sense of who you are and what you're looking for in a 
website. It's really important to nail down what features you need, as this
sppeds things up later. It also helps me decide what kind of technology will 
best suit your site. Are you mostly doing just a static site? A blog? 
E-commerce? During this phase, I'll also ask you to send me links of things you 
like in other sites — this could be designs, color pallettes, features, etc.

Once we've established the overall design, sitemap and features, I move to 
prototyping with [Figma](https://www.figma.com). Ths great thing about this 
tool is that you can see what I'm doing live, which fascilitates collaboration 
in this step.

After that, it's time for coding! That is the fun part. (Well, for me.)

<h2 class="fs-700 mt">A note on Wordpress</h2>

Wordpress isn't my first choice for new websites, as I think there are way 
better options that are more resilient, easier to maintain, and less prone to 
security vulnerabilities. But, if you are adamant on having a Wordpress site, 
I will absolutely work with you on it.

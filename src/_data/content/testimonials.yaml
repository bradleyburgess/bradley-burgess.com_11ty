    Bradley is an exceptional instructor. I have been playing the piano and organ for
    over 50 years and he has taught me practicing techniques that I have never
    used before. His knowledge, and ability to share it with the student, is
    excellent. He is a gifted musician himself and helps inspire me to always
    improve.

#     Bradley has been a fantastic piano teacher for our son. He's experienced,
#     knowledgeable, and patient, as you would expect from any good teacher. But
#     he's also remarkably insightful and flexible as he molds his instruction to
#     our son's needs and strengths. Lessons are always really focused and at the
#     same time super upbeat and positive.

    Bradley is an outstanding organ teacher. What sets him apart is his broad
    knowledge of repertoire and technique combined with large doses of patience.
    I learn something new each time we meet! I can't recommend him too highly.

    I had been playing the organ in church for years and wanted to learn more. 
    Bradley has been patient and encouraging at every step along the way. He 
    has been able to teach me techniques and tips that make playing the organ 
    fun. Bradley's organ repertoire is impressive and his skill is amazing. He 
    is the best instructor I have ever had.

    It's so easy for me to add content to my blog! I didn't have a clear idea of
    how I wanted it to look, but Bradley managed to take my few ideas and make it
    look really great. He also added new features I needed in record time.

    All through the process Bradley amazed me. I'm so happy with how the redesigned
    site turned out. He is also so responsive and so quick to make changes. I
    couldn't be happier.
